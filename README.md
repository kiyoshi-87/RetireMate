# RETIREMENT PLANNING APP

It provides tools and calculators that help users determine how much they need to save for retirement, estimate their retirement income, and track their progress towards their retirement goals.



## Our vision so far for these app : 

- User Interface:
  The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface to make it easy for users to input and manage their data. The interface should include options to input financial and personal data, as well as to set retirement goals and view progress towards those goals.

- User Authentication:
  The application should have a secure user authentication system to protect user data and ensure privacy. Users can create accounts using email addresses and passwords. Optionally, the application can also support two-factor authentication for added security.

- Retirement Savings Calculator:
  The application should have a savings calculator to help users estimate how much they need to save to achieve their retirement goals. The calculator should take into account the user's current age, retirement age, desired retirement lifestyle, and expected retirement income sources.

- Retirement Expense Estimator:
  The application should have an expense estimator to help users estimate their retirement expenses. The estimator should take into account factors such as the user's current living expenses, healthcare expenses, and other expenses related to retirement.

- Retirement Income Estimator:
  The application should have an income estimator to help users estimate their retirement income sources. The estimator should take into account factors such as the user's current income, social security benefits, pension income, and other sources of income.

- Savings Tracker:
  The application should have a savings tracker to help users monitor their progress towards their retirement savings goals. The tracker should show how much the user has saved so far, how much they need to save to reach their goal, and how much time they have left to save.

- Investment Recommendations:
  The application can provide users with investment recommendations based on their retirement goals and risk tolerance. The recommendations can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment options.

- Reporting:
  The application should provide users with detailed reports on their retirement savings progress, retirement income, and expenses. Reports can be generated on a weekly, monthly, or annual basis.

- Integration with financial institutions:
  The application can integrate with financial institutions to allow users to link their retirement accounts and track their progress towards their goals.

- Security and Privacy:
  The application should prioritize security and privacy. All user data should be encrypted and protected using industry-standard security protocols. Users should have the ability to control their privacy settings and choose what information they want to share with the application.
